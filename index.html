<h1 style="font-size: 200%; text-align: center;">Welcome!</h1>


<p>I'm Jun Wei (Luke), a student who's interested in physics and mathematics.</p>

<p>I take part in many of the high school science competitions, such as the International Science Olympiads, as well as their national versions, have a look at the full list in the achievements tab</p>

<p>One of the things I'm currently studying right now is the applications of topology to physics</p>

<p>Eventually you'll be able to see a list of my publications in the research page</p>
