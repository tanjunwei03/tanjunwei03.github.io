Progress: Awaiting approval for the final version to be archived and submitted for peer review.

For a given system, determining the hamiltonian and hence the energy spectrum is easy. However, the reverse process has been an open problem. This poses a problem as nonhermitian systems must still have real spectra for them to be stable. In this paper, we design a new and novel method for generating a hamiltonian that with an arbitrary OBC and PBC spectrum.
