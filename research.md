# Designing Non-Hermitian Real Spectra Through Electrostatics
{: style="font-size: 150%"}
Progress: Manuscript submitted to <em>Science Bulletin</em>

Non-hermiticity presents a vast newly opened territory that harbors new physics and applications such as lasing and sensing. However, only non-Hermitian systems with real eigenenergies are stable, and great efforts have been devoted in designing them through enforcing parity-time (PT) symmetry. In this work, we exploit a lesser-known dynamical mechanism for enforcing real-spectra, and develop a comprehensive and versatile approach for designing new classes of parent Hamiltonians with real spectra. Our design approach is based on a novel electrostatics analogy for modified non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence, where electrostatic charge corresponds to density of states and electric fields correspond to complex spectral flow. As such, Hamiltonians of any desired spectra and state localization profile can be reverse-engineered, particularly those without any guiding symmetry principles. By recasting the diagonalization of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians as a Poisson boundary value problem, our electrostatics analogy also transcends the gain/loss-induced compounding of floating-point errors in traditional numerical methods, thereby allowing access to far larger system sizes.

Progress: It shall stay on my website and my website only...

The rising rate of singlehood presents one of the most grave threats to mankind. However, current research into this dire circumstance focuses on national or international scale socioeconomic driving factors, rather than on small scale influencing factors more relevant to the general population. In addition, there have been little such studies conducted in a local (Singapore) context. In this work, we gather a data set describing oneâ€™s marital status and height, before exploiting celebrated statistical methods such as the t-test and conducting detailed analysis on said data. We come to statistically significant results for males that people in a romantic relationship are generally taller than their compatriots, with the result not being statistically significant in females.
